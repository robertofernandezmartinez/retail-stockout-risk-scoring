# 🛒 Retail Stockout Risk Scoring

This project predicts **retail stockout risk within 14 days** and estimates the **economic impact** of potential stockouts.  
A trained XGBoost model evaluates products and identifies those that require urgent replenishment.

The solution includes:
- Automated **feature engineering, resampling**, and model training
- A **Streamlit** web app for business users
- A **deployed scoring pipeline** ready for production
- **Expected Loss** analytics to prioritize inventory decisions

## 🚀 Live Application

Try the app here 👇  
👉 **https://retail-stockout-risk-scoring.streamlit.app/**

Upload a CSV containing store inventory data and receive:
- Stockout probability per product
- Expected economic loss estimation
- Full ranked table of most critical items

---

## 📌 Key Features

✔ Stockout prediction within 14 days  
✔ Handles **class imbalance** using RandomOverSampler  
✔ **Economic Loss** calculator  
✔ Clean reusable ML pipeline  
✔ Deployment-ready model stored in GitHub Releases  
✔ Interactive UI for planners & business teams

## 📊 Expected Loss Formula

To support business prioritization, we compute:

> **Expected Loss (€) = Stockout_Risk × Daily_Demand × Price × Stockout_Duration**

Where:
- **Stockout_Risk** → model-predicted probability
- **Daily_Demand** → expected units sold per day
- **Price** → product selling price (€)
- **Stockout_Duration** → number of days impacted if stockout occurs (set to 14 in this version)

This allows ranking products not only by probability of shortage,  
but also **financial impact**, improving decision-making.
